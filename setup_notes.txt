# 1) clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/ml4tp/gamepad.git

# 2) run get_data.sh
./get_data.sh

# 3) install opam and configure the version
# install instructions: https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html
# after opam is installed:
opam switch 4.05.0
eval `opam config env`
opam install camlp4
opam install ocamlfind

# Note that it is normal to see message "LablGtk2 not found: => no CoqIde will be built."

# 4) configure / build tcoq, then update environment
./setup_tcoq.sh
./build_tcoq.sh
source build_config.sh

# 5) build ssreflect
patch math-comp/mathcomp/ssreflect/plugin/v8.6/ssreflect.ml4 ssreflect/ssreflect.ml4.patch
./build_mathcomp.sh

# Note that it is normal to see: make clean failed due to "No rule to make target 'Makefile.coq'"
# this will take awhile

# 6) collect their dataset

which coqc # should show something like /home/xujie/Projects/gamepad_env/gamepad/tcoq/build/bin/coqc

./build_oddorder.sh
# again, it is normal to see: make clean failed due to "No rule to make target 'Makefile.coq'"
